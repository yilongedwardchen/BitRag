**BitRag** is an innovative, open-source Bitcoin price analysis system that harnesses the power of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with the cutting-edge **DeepSeek V3** model. Designed to deliver real-time insights into Bitcoin market trends, BitRag collects, processes, and analyzes a wealth of data‚Äîincluding price, trading volume, whale transactions, and news‚Äîmaking it an essential tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, traders, and developers alike. With a robust, scalable architecture built on modern technologies like Kafka, Pathway, PostgreSQL, Milvus, and LangChain, BitRag is fully containerized using Docker for seamless deployment and operation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

BitRag‚Äôs architecture is a symphony of interconnected components, designed for performance and scalability:

- **Data Collectors**: Custom Python scripts (`price_collector.py`, `transaction_collector.py`, `news_collector.py`) fetch data from external APIs with precision.
- **Kafka Streaming**: Handles real-time data flow through dedicated topics like `bitcoin_price_updates`, `whale_transactions`, and `crypto_news`.
- **Pathway Processing**: Processes Kafka streams with minimal latency, feeding raw data to PostgreSQL and embeddings to Milvus.
- **PostgreSQL Storage**: Archives raw data (prices, transactions, news) for historical analysis and querying.
- **Milvus Vector Store**: Manages vector embeddings of news articles, enabling efficient similarity searches.
- **LangChain & DeepSeek V3**: Drives the RAG engine, delivering smart, context-rich responses.
- **FastAPI Interface**: Provides a sleek REST API for seamless user interaction.
